<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How many days should I set cycles to last for?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Generally, I recommend setting it to as long as you think you could be bothered to wait for. I think about 8 days is the best mix of not having to wait for ever and not having a sim's fertile window be too short.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How short could I reasonably make a cycle last?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>All though you are allowed to go to about as low as 1 day, I do not recommend less than 3 days. At around 3 days or less, you will start to experience some issues. For example, your sim's periods might be too short for the effects to actually appear. If you elect play with such short cycles, the use of quick mode basically required in order to have the any possibility of pregnancy.
