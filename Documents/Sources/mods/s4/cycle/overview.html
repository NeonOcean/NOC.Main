<p>Cycle adds menstruation and woohoo risk as problems your sims must deal with. Trying for babies is no longer so easy, and having a night of ecstasy with your partner is no longer so safe. Use caution to avoid unwanted rug rats or carefully track your sim's fertility in order start a family.</p>

<p><i><b>Note: </b>This mod plays best with long or even paused lifespans. Those of you who enjoy playing with many generations of sims; this mod is likely not a good match for you.</i></p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Adds a nuanced simulation of the menstrual cycle to sims who should have one.</li>
	<li>Adds negative moodlets that can appear when a sim starts their period.</li>
	<li>Pregnancy can now only start if a sim woohoos while fertile.</li>
	<li>Teenagers can now get pregnant through their 'mess around' interaction if they are not careful.</li>
	<li>Regular woohoo is now dangerous, sims must now buy protection, avoid woohoo on fertile days, or risk it with the withdraw method.</li>
	<li>Condoms, birth control pills, pregnancy tests, and morning-after pills are all available to be used by your sims.</li>
	<li>Allows your sims to get pregnant and leave who the real father is a mystery to you. (Increase pregnancy length to better experience this feature) (Better support for this coming in the future)</li>
	<li>Use the cycle tracker phone app to keep track of fertility and menstruation.</li>
	<li>New items that both have special functionality and work well as decorative clutter.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Features Coming Soon</h1>
<i>These features are planned to be added very soon.</i>
<ul>
	<li>Miscarriages could occur randomly through bad luck or by your sims doing actions harmful to their baby's health. This feature will support the mod <i>Basemental Drugs</i>.
	<li>Abortions will be available to have done by a doctor. I also want to make it so that players can set whether or not abortions are legal to have for sims living in certain neighborhoods, simulating real life abortion laws varying by state and country. Places where it's illegal would require sims to take risky action to abort their pregnancy.</li>
	<li>Birth control pills will require a perscription from a doctor.</li>
	<li>Teens will be more restricted in their ability to acquire birth control pills and abortions. They would have to ask their parents if it's okay first to avoid punishment. Parents might not allow their teens to do this so getting an abortion or birth control pills might require some sneaking around.</li>
	<li>Sims who have slept with multiple partners around the time pregnancy began shouldn't automatically know who the father is. In the future, babies will not list their father if the mother doesn't know who it is. A paternity test would be required to find out the truth.</li>
	<li>Teens will have to admit to their parents about their pregnancy and risk punishment.</li>
	<li>Pregnancy isn't always something you wanted, so sims shouldn't be forced with a moodlet that declares how happy or excited they are.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How do I buy woohoo protection?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>You can buy such items with a computer, just go to the order menu and select "Purchase From Protect Tech". Alternatively, If your living off the grid or just don't own a computer, you can order woohoo protection buy mail using a mail box.

	<b>A: </b>Download the Dot Period & Ovulation Tracker app to the phone of a sim who has a menstrual cycle and select the "show cycle status" option.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How can I adjust long a menstrual cycle should last?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Click any sim and go to NeonOcean > Cycle > Mod Settings. Once you've entered the mod settings dialog go to Time Settings > Reproductive Speed.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How many days should I set cycles to last for?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Generally, I recommend setting it to as long as you think you could be bothered to wait for. I think about 8 days is the best mix of not having to wait for ever and not having a sim's fertile window be too short.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How short could I reasonably make a cycle last?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>All though you are allowed to go to about as low as 1 day, I do not recommend less than 3 days. At around 3 days or less, you will start to experience some issues. For example, your sim's periods might be too short for the effects to actually appear. If you elect play with such short cycles, the use of quick mode basically required in order to have the any possibility of pregnancy.
