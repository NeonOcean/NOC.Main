<h1>Incompatible Mods</h1>
<ul>
	<li><u><i>MC Woohoo</i> by Deaderpool</u> - This causes the try for baby interactions to not consider fertility. Normal woohoo works as intended, but use of the risky woohoo setting will likely cause this to break too. This mod would be supported <i>right now</i>, but the creator felt the need protect their <i>MOD FOR THE SIMS 4's</i> source code as if its a big government secret.</li>
	<br/>
	<li><u><i>Slice of Life (Menstrual Cycle Module)</i> by kawaiistacie</u> - You only need to delete the menstrual cycle module, everything else should work fine. Leaving the menstruation module in will cause your sims to have two cycles at once. Nothing is lost by using this mod instead, the Slice of Life version is relatively simplistic.</li>
