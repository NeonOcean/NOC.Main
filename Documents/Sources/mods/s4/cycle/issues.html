<h1>Incompatible Mods</h1>
<ul>
	<li><u><i>MC Woohoo</i> by Deaderpool</u> - This causes the try for baby interactions to not consider fertility. Normal woohoo works as intended, but use of the risky woohoo setting will likely cause this to break too.</li>
	<li><u><i>Wicked Whims</i> by TURBODRIVER</u> - The, uh, "woohoo" interactions in this mod probably won't trigger sperm to transfer between sims.</li>
