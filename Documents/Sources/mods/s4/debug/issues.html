<h1>Incompatible Mods</h1>
<ul>
	<li><u><i>Sims Log Enabler</i> by Scumbumbo</u> - This mod is completely incompatible as it entirely replaces functions in The Sims 4's logging system instead of patching them. This is not a horrible problem though as the mod is inferior to Debug, there will be no loss in functionality if you use Debug as a replacement.</li>
