<p>Debug is a mod that allows creators to get a better picture of how things go wrong in their mods. It works to accomplish this by enabling built in logging system latent in The Sims 4. With this mod in the hands of a regular user, it would allow them to send mod creators potentially far more detailed reports in the event they encounter an unexpected problem.</p>
