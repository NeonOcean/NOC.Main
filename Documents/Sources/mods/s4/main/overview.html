<p>Main is a mod that contains a set of tools that other mods may well rely on to function. Previously this tool set was only available for use by NeonOcean, but at this point, it is now open to everyone. Main would potentially reduce the amount of work that is necessary to make complex mods, as they would no longer need to create their own systems for things like saving data.</p>

<p>If you are a mod creator, you should check out the documentation for a bit of explanation of the parts of this mod. The source code is also available for use as a reference in the files tab.</p>
