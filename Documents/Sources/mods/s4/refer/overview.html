<p>Refer is a mod that allows sims to finally be talked about with pronouns that match their gender identity. Gender non-conforming sims can now easily change their preferred pronouns, sims can swap between the "male" and "female" pronouns, switch to using they / them, or select a "neopronoun" to be called by.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b> This mod currently only works if your using the English version of the game.</li></i></p>

<h1>Questions and Answers</h1>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>Can I install this mod without having to start a new game?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Yes! You should be able to install this mod at any point in your play-through without issue.
	
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How easy is it to remove this mod? Will uninstalling it break my save game?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>This mod can be easily removed by deleting all its files or using the mod's included uninstaller. Removing this mod mid play-through should cause no issues.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>Will this mod increase my load time a lot?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>This mod may add a few seconds (or longer depending on how bad your computer is) when a save is first loaded as we need to find all to localization text in the game. Thankfully, we save what we found so subsequent first loads will not take as long. When ever the game updates, this load time increase may appear again as we will likely need to check for new text. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>How do I change my sim's preferred pronouns?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Click any sim and go to NeonOcean > Refer > Pronoun Settings. Select the "Pronouns" option in the dialog that appears to choose the sim's preferred pronouns.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>Will you add in a way for gender non-conforming sims to ask others to use their preferred pronouns?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>I might add in a simple interaction to allow this but it wouldn't affect whether or not others use your sim's pronouns as there is no real way to determine who's talking. Just think of the sims world as one in which even your worst enemy respects your pronouns and everyone can use telepathy to determine what your preferred pronouns are. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>A set of pronouns I want my sim to use isn't in this mod, is there any way for me to add them?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>Right now, there is no way for you to add in a custom pronoun set. But I do plan to add in a way soon.
