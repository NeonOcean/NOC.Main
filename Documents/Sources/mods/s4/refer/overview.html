Gender non-conforming sims can now easily change their preferred pronouns, sims can swap between the "male" and "female" pronouns, switch to using they / them, or select a "neopronoun" to be called by.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b> This mod currently only works if your using the English version of the game.</li></i></p>

<p>
	<b>Q: <i>Will you add in a way for gender non-conforming sims to ask others to use their preferred pronouns?</i></b><br />
	<b>A: </b>I might add in a simple interaction to allow this but it wouldn't affect whether or not others use your sim's pronouns as there is no real way to determine who's talking. Just think of the sims world as one in which even your worst enemy respects your pronouns and everyone can use telepathy to determine what your preferred pronouns are.
