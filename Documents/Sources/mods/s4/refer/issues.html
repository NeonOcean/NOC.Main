<p>I don't know a lot about gender neutral pronouns beyond what I learned while doing research for this mod. Tell me if I've done something wrong while creating this mod. neonoceanpurple@gmail.com</p>

<h1>Unsolvable problems</h1>
<p>These issues exist because they would be very difficult or even impossible to fix.</p>

<ul>
	<b><i><li>They / Them Pronoun Issues</li></b></i>
	<ul>
		<li>"She's" and "he's" does not have a direct replacement for they / them pronouns. Both "they're" and "they've" work in different cases and its not really feasible for this mod to automatically detect when to use which. The only way I could fix this issue was to manually set which to use for each case. This means that Refer will ignore any instances of "she's" and "he's" that may occur in other mods not explicitly supported.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Using they / them pronoun may result in grammatically incorrect sentences in a few cases. There isn't any real way to rewrite the sentences on the fly or even detect if using they or them is grammatically incorrect. I recommend using a "neopronoun" instead if you really want to avoid this issue.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<b><i><li>General Issues</li></b></i>
	<ul>
		<li>The game will occasionally use your sim's pronouns to refer to sims that don't actually exist in the world. For example, the game may make up a fake co-worker in the situational "should your sim do x or should they do y" dialogs and refer to them in the same way they do your sim.</li>
